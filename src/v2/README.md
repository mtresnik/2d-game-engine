# 2d-game-engine (v2)

A lighter-weight and more intuitive game engine for Java.
-
In the this version of the game engine, users can:

- Define mouse collision events
- Model entities and structures using the JBox2d collision handling
- Save levels to XML files
- Edit levels while testing them (multiple threads)
- Import GIFs or multiple PNGs to use as sprite objects
- Change animation times of different sprites
- Handle keyboard events and mouse events
- Handle sound events and display events
- Use z-filtering for objects that are closer to the screen (creates illusion of depth)
